		<h1>WHAT IS THE CAPSTONE PROGRAM?</h1>
		<p>
    The Capstone Program is a project-based, academic course where sponsors provide industry projects
    for our students. The Ying Wu College of Computing (YWCC) Capstone Program offers a very
    cost-effective solution for your business with a high return on your investment by using the help
    of driven, talented and well-trained CS, IS and IT students from NJIT. Capstone is a required course
    for all of our undergraduate students and has recently been added as an elective for our graduate
    students.
    </p><p>
    Capstone teams are composed of 2-4 well-trained and talented students working on our Sponsors’
    projects for at least 12 weeks. Our students will work on sponsor project(s) as focused, teams of
    consultants with carefully selected leaders and mentors. They utilize a continuous process
    improvement strategy, on a biweekly basis, managed by a course instructor and our executive team.
    Students also receive mentorship, training and support from our Capstone leadership and executive
    team as well as access to a variety of other resources in our network.
    </p><p>
    With over a decade of history, the YWCC Capstone program is an exceptional educational experience
    designed to empower students and mirror their interests via real world project-based learning and
    hands-on training. This program has delivered outstanding results in more than 1,200
    industry-sponsored projects with more than 700 organizations. The YWCC Capstone program has
    received numerous awards including national and state-wide recognition.
    </p><p>
    Student teams tackle projects in a very broad array of application domains from network
    engineering to software engineering and much more. The capstone program is very
    selective in accepting projects and deciding to work with potential sponsoring organizations
    based on composite criteria and students’ votes and interests.
    </p><p>
    Our goal for Capstone students is to develop critical skills such as leadership
    empowerment, strategic problem-solving and real world learning experiences. During the
    Capstone program, students use evolutionary prototyping via five sprints to complete
    projects. Our sponsors act as partners, mentors, and coaches with weekly communication
    and biweekly in-class meetings (including Showcases). Students provide their sponsors
    tangible results every two weeks, and are expected to provide feedback to the teams.
