            <p>CCS capstone was established 16 years ago, as program that is so much more than just real world experience through projects.
              As a network of networks, the multidisciplinary capstone today is changing how classrooms operate and redefining how students are learning, running a free real world open university year-round, transforming the way business work with education, impacting K-12 education, health care and social services in the City of Newark and NJ and partnering with the world to empower our students.</p>
