		<p>The following are the steps to apply to become part of the Capstone projects. Please follow these steps carefully. If you have any questions please contact [insert contact email / phone]</p><br/>
    <p>An Overview: <br/>
    <a href="#application">1. Complete the application form at the provided link</a><br/>
    <a href="#guidelines">2. Complete and Fax the Guidelines and Acknowledgment form</a><br/>

    <p>Below is a copy of our NJIT NDA that we require from all our students to sign to protect all parties involved for your reference to view.  While the vast majority of our capstone sponsors consider this NDA totally sufficient, very few may suggest an alternative NDA, which is not generally recommended.  If absolutely necessary, you MUST make this request when you submit your proposal separately with your proposed changes or alternative NDA. We can’t guarantee that NJIT will approve your request. If you don’t make such a request on time, we will assume that you accept NJIT’s provided NDA to protect your IP. A delayed request may cancel your project proposal automatically since it will overlap with the actual semester timeframe and delay our students. We can’t, however, allow our students to sign any alternative NDA unless it is approved by our NJIT legal advisors.</p>

   <a href="http://fs7.formsite.com/eljabiri2/CCS_Capstone_Proposal/">Click Here For The Application Form</a>
   <p>
      You can expect our decision within a week max of the deadline above. Early submission may receive special consideration for earlier approvals. We will notify you immediately once our advisory team approves your proposal. Even though we have now a larger capacity than any time in the past few years, we receive a large number of projects that usually exceed our capacity. This is, of course, after meeting our criteria first.</p>
   <p>
      Please note that if your project was approved, you must present the project to our students on-campus (at the Open House) and meet with them to select your team at our Sponsors Open House on Saturday Feb 3rd, 2018 from 12-5PM at NJIT’s Campus Center Atrium. Unfortunately, sponsors who don’t attend this open house, would normally have their projects cancelled automatically.

   <h2>&#126; Contribution Payment &#126;</h2>
   <p>All sponsors are expected to make the  required minimum contribution after receiving the email approval to NJIT Foundation (Capstone Program account index # 200094), which is tax exempt. Projects without the required minimum contribution are cancelled automatically and will not be part of the open house. The amount of this contribution is $2000 per a standard 4-people team $1500 per a medium size 3-people team and $1000 per a small 2-people team for small projects. Please be advised that sponsor contribution is not a fee for service but rather a shared responsibility of capstone expenses among all sponsors. These expenses are 100% students-driven which includes students meals, cash prizes, events resources, prints, external training needs, supplies, extended programs, etc.   If your project was not selected for any reason at the open house, your contribution will be refunded upon your request.
